# TEXTCRAFT

Textcraft is an oldskool text-based MUD with a twist -- it's peer-to-peer.

There are no servers. YOU own your data.

It relies on [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p) for peer-to-peer networking and uses [libp2p-websocket](https://github.com/zot/libp2p-websocket) to connect browsers to libp2p.

For many more details, see this readme: (html/README.md)

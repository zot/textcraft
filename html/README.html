<h1>TEXTCRAFT</h1>
<p>Textcraft is an oldskool text-based MUD with a twist -- it's peer-to-peer.</p>
<p>There are no servers. YOU own your data.</p>
<p>It relies on <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p">libp2p</a> for peer-to-peer networking and uses <a href="https://github.com/zot/libp2p-websocket">libp2p-websocket</a> to connect browsers to libp2p.</p>
<h1>MIT LICENSE</h1>
<p>The MIT license is <a href="LICENSE">here</a></p>
<h1>Using the MUD</h1>
<ol>
<li>Start by creating or uploading a MUD (using the Create or Upload buttons)</li>
<li>Activate the MUD, your default user should have admin privileges</li>
<li>A new MUD will start you in the lobby</li>
<li>Create a room: <code>@create room The Dark Forest</code></li>
<li>Link it to your current room: <code>@link here north south %-1</code> -- <code>%-1</code> refers to the last created thing</li>
<li>Lock the north exit: <code>@set north locked true</code></li>
<li>Create a key generator: <code>@create generator a pile of keys</code></li>
<li>Fix up the name of the generator: <code>@set %-1 name key</code></li>
<li>Add the exit to the keys property on the key: <code>@add key keys north</code></li>
<li>Drop the key generator so other people can get it: <code>drop key</code></li>
<li>Try going north: <code>north</code></li>
<li>Pick up a key: <code>get key</code> -- this actually copies the generator key</li>
<li>Really go north: <code>north</code></li>
<li>Toast your key copy: <code>@toast key</code></li>
<li>Go south (south isn't locked -- you could lock it and add it to the key generator)</li>
<li>Try going north</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example MUDs</h2>
<p>Shift-click or right-click and choose &quot;Save link as...&quot; to save these to your disk</p>
<ul>
<li><a href='javascript:window.textcraft ? textcraft.Gui.activateMudFromURL("examples/Key%20Example.yaml") : document.location = "examples/Key%20Example.yaml"'>Key and Lock</a></li>
<li><a href='javascript:window.textcraft ? textcraft.Gui.activateMudFromURL("examples/Extension%20Example.yaml") : document.location = "examples/Extension%20Example.yaml"'>Simple Extension</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating things</h2>
<p>When you create something with @create, you need a prototype, like this: <code>@create thing stone</code></p>
<p>You can see a list of prototypes with the <code>@info</code> command.</p>
<p>You can list any prototype with <code>%proto:NAME</code>, like this: <code>@dump %proto:room</code></p>
<h2>Format strings</h2>
<p>Various commands like <code>output</code> and <code>look</code> use format strings with special codes that start with $ in properties like description or examineFormat. Commands like look print a format string with arguments (look uses the description property).</p>
<p>Some format string properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>description     -- Used when someone looks at the object</li>
<li>contentsFormat  -- Used when displaying this thing as part of the contents of its location</li>
<li>examineFormat   -- Used by the examine command and the look command for your location or yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the help command and check out the documentation for @set for more info on the properties</p>
<p>Some format codes:</p>
<ul>
<li>$forme ...      -- Use the text after $forme when it is outputting to the user</li>
<li>$forothers ...  -- Use the text after $forothers if it is outputting to users other than the actor</li>
<li>$actor          -- The formated name of the thing running the command</li>
<li>$thing          -- The current thing (like the object you're looking at in a look command)</li>
<li>$arg            -- The first format argument ($arg1 also works)</li>
<li>$arg2           -- The second format argument</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the help command and check out the format string documentation for more info.</p>
<h2>Command templates</h2>
<p>An object can add or enhance commands if it contains a command property and a) the user is holding it, b) it is the user's location, or c) it is a link on the user's location.</p>
<p>Command properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>cmd       -- The object's name becomes a command</li>
<li>cmd_NAME  -- NAME becomes a command</li>
<li>go        -- If you are going into the object, this replaces the go comand</li>
<li>go_NAME   -- If you are going NAME, this replaces the go comand</li>
<li>get       -- If you are getting the object, this replaces the get command</li>
<li>get_NAME  -- If you are getting NAME, this replaces the get command</li>
</ul>
<p>Command templates can use $N to substitute in the command's arguments (and 'me' for the actor).</p>
<ul>
<li>$0 is the object itself</li>
<li>$1...$N are the words in the command (so go north will have $0 as the exit and $1 as 'north' which may be useful in a go_north property)</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the help command for more details</p>
<h1>MUD Commands</h1>
<p>Here are all of the current commands and the current help documentation:</p>
<pre><code>@add thing property thing2                                      --  Add thing2 to the list or set in property

@output contextThing &quot;FORMAT&quot; arg... @event actor EVENT arg...  --  Output text to the user and/or others using a format string on contextThing
  if the format is for others, @output will issue a descripton using information after @event
  actor can change output depending on who receives it
@quiet                                                          --  disable all output for this command

  linkowner   -- set the thing's linkOwner
  otherlink   -- set the thing's otherLink
  description -- the thing's description, you can use format words in a description (see FORMAT WORDS).
                 If you capitalize a format word, the substitution will be capitalized.

  Here are the fields you can set:
    name            -- simple one-word name for this object, for commands to find it

You can use me for yourself, here for your location, and out for your location's location (if you're in a container)
You can use %lobby, %limbo, and %protos for the standard rooms
You can use %proto:name for a prototype
You can use %NUMBER for an object by its ID (try @dump me for an example)
You can use %-NUMBER for an item you created recently (%-1 is the last item, %-2 is the next to last, etc.)
You can use %result to refer to the result of the active successful if-condition
You can use %result.PROPERTY to refer to a property of the result (including numeric indexes)
You can use %event to refer to the current event (descripton)
You can use %event.PROPERTY to refer to a property of the current event (descripton)

To make something into a prototype, move it to %protos

FORMAT WORDS:
  $this        -- formatted string for this object or &quot;you&quot; if the user is the thing
  $name        -- this object's name
  $is          -- is or are, depending on the plurality of the thing
  $s           -- optional &quot;s&quot; depending on the plurality of the thing (or &quot;es&quot; if it's after go)
  $location    -- the thing's location
  $owner       -- the link's owner (if this is a link)
  $link        -- the link's destination (if this is a link)
  $contents    -- the things's contents
  $links       -- the things's links
  $forme       -- following content is for messages shown to a command's actor
  $forothers   -- following content is for messages shown to observers of a command's actor
  $arg         -- first argument (if there is one)
  $argN        -- Nth argument (if there is one)
  $result      -- The result of the active successful if-condition
  $result.PROP -- A property of the current result (including numeric indexes)
  $event       -- The current event (descripton)
  $event.PROP  -- A property of the current event (descripton)


COMMAND TEMPLATES:

Command templates are string properties on objects to implement custom commands.
Example command template properties are get_key, cmd, and cmd_whistle -- see the help for @set.
Templates replace the original command with different commands, separated by semicolons.
Templates can contain $0..$N to refer to the command arguments. $0 refers to the thing itself.


EXPRESSIONS:

The following are legal expressions:
   number
   string
   boolean
   null
   undefined
   THING
   THING.property
   %any.property   -- returns the first value found on you or thing in your inventory
                      If property is a collection, it returns the union of all found
   '(' expr ')'
   expr1 + expr2
   expr1 - expr2
   expr1 * expr2
   expr1 / expr2
   expr1 &lt; expr2
   expr1 &lt;= expr2
   expr1 &gt; expr2
   expr1 &gt;= expr2
   Expr1 == expr2
   expr1 != expr2
   !expr1
   expr1 &amp;&amp; expr2
   expr1 || expr2
   expr1 in expr2  -- returns whether expr1 is in expr2 (which must be a collection or a thing)


EVENTS:

When a thing executes a command, it emits an event which propagates to nearby things. Objects can react
to a type of event by setting a property called react_EVENT to a command template (see COMMAND TEMPLATES).
Events have properties which you can access in command templates with %event.PROPERTY and in format
strings with $event.PROPERTY.

Example, this will make a box react to people arriving in its location:

@set box react_go @if %event.1 == $0.location @then say Hello %event.source!


EVENT PROPERTIES:

   failed  -- whether the event is from a failed command
   source  -- the thing that emitted the event
   tick    -- the current tick number
   N       -- %event.0 ... %event.N and $event.0 ... $event.N refer to parameters in the event


EVENT TYPES:

These are the standard event types, listed with their standard parameters:

   get 0:thing
   drop 0:thing
   go 0:oldLocation 1:newLocation
   look 0:thing
   examine 0:thing
   tick
   say 0:text
   act 0:text 1:thing(opt)

<h1>Extensions</h1>
<p>Each MUD can have extensions. There is an example extension <a href="html/js/exampleExtension.ts">here</a></p>
<p>Extensions can optionally provide onStarted and onLoggedIn functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-TypeScript">function onStarted(world: World, con: MudConnection)

function onLoggedIn(user: any, thing: Thing)
</code></pre>
<p>They can import Textcraft modules by using the prefix <code>/js/</code> for module files (see example).</p>
<h1>Four levels of building</h1>
<ol>
<li>Creating things and setting properties</li>
<li>Using command templates</li>
<li>Writing extensions (like for game mechanics)</li>
<li>Changing the Textcraft executable</li>
</ol>
<h1>MUD Model</h1>
<h2>The Thing class</h2>
<p>The World is made of things, and only things. Each room is a thing. Exits between rooms are things. People are things. Items are things. Boxes are things.</p>
<p>Bill's good friend, Fritz Passow, came up with this idea, which he called &quot;Container MUD&quot;, where everything is a container.</p>
<p>The Thing class has these properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>id: an identifying number for this thing, unique among things</li>
<li>name: the name; since this is used in commands, spaces are not allowed</li>
<li>description: the description</li>
<li>location: the thing this is located in -- if this is a link, it has no location</li>
<li>contents: things inside this thing</li>
<li>links: links (which are things) attached to this thing</li>
<li>linkOwner: the thing that owns this link, if this is a link</li>
<li>otherLink: the companion to this link, if this is a link</li>
</ul>
<h1>More later...</h1>
<p>For the moment, there are basic instructions for developing the MUD, below.</p>
<h1>Installing typescript</h1>
<pre><code class="language-shell">npm install -g typescript
</code></pre>
<h1>Using typescript</h1>
<p>Run this in one terminal to compile as you edit -- note that we are using <code>--target esnext</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">tsc -w
</code></pre>
<h1>USE TSLINT!!!</h1>
<p>in another terminal, run this every now and then and <em>certainly</em> before pushing to a shared branch</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">tslint -p tsconfig.json
</code></pre>
<p>Run this in another terminal to serve up the web page -- we use modules so file:/// won't work :(. This will run the server on port 8888. You can change it with the -port option.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">textcraft
</code></pre>
<h1>Things to look out for with async functions with database operations</h1>
<p>When you call an async function, make sure to use await or return or the transaction will be lost!</p>
